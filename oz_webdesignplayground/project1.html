That's because, according to the linguist Victoria Neufeldt (writing
in her book A Civil But Untrammelled Tongue),
<strong>most word invention goes on as a matter of course</strong>
</p>
<p>
    But for every word with a definite origin, there are hundreds,
nay <em>thousands</em>, whose beginnings are unknown and probably
unknowable.

<div>
    That&rsquo;s because, according to the linguist Victoria Neufeldt
(writing in her book <i>A Civil But Untrammelled Tongue</i>),
<strong>most word invention goes on as a matter of course</
strong>:
<blockquote>
Neology, far from being a separable linguistic phenomenon that
manifests itself periodically or sporadically in response
to social stimuli, in fact rises out of ordinary linguistic
competence, what might be called the linguistic collective
unconscious of the speech community.
</blockquote>
This <q><span> linguistic competence</span></q> manifests as various
mechanisms that people use to forge new words:
</div>
<h2>Shortening</h2>
<div>
The <b>shortening</b> process is based mostly on a kind of
linguistic laziness called <b>clipping</b> that causes us to lop
off great chunks of words. For example, we end up with <i>fridge</
i> from <i>refrigerator</i> and <em>flu</em> from <i>influenza</
i>. Often we clip everything after the first syllable: <i>dis</i>
(from <i>disrespect</i>) and <i>gym</i> (from <i>gymnasium</i>).
</div>
<div>
A related process is the creation of <b>acronyms</b>, which
form a pronounceable word using the first letters of each word
in a phrase. For example, <i>UNICEF</i> from United Nations
International Children&rsquo;s Emergency Fund, and <i>NATO</i>
from North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
